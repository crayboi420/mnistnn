# mnistnn
This is a my first neural network that I'm creating with the goal being to get a good accuracy on the MNIST datatset.
The goal is to create a class with all the parameters ready to be used as a classifier neural network and to be able to use it everywhere.
Currently, the neural network only supports a single thread and the loss function is hardcoded MSE. The single threading issue is the main focus now.
I hope that I can incorporate multi threading with the goal being GPU accelarated support.
